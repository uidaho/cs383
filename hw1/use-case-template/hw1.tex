\section{Program Premise}
Major expansion (``fleshing out'') of the basic premise of this program Agree with your team on the basics (objective(s)), and then break this task out into individual or 2-person assignments.

\section{Application Domain Study}
An examination and test of a similar (previous and/or manual) system.

\section{Use Case Descriptions}
Identify how many distinct kinds of user/player tasks are required. A task is a set of user actions that combine together to form a single indivisible phase a distinct change of state for those phases where multiple changes of state can occur.

\subsection{use case title}
Your assessment of the requirements for a computer adaptation of your assigned parts of the application domain. How will manual elements be translated? What parts have to change? What parts of the manual (or legacy) system can be retained as-is? You can include sketches or sample screen shots of what various application domain elements should look like in the new system.
A set of use case descriptions of the tasks in \#1 above. Read the lecture notes (and/or google it) for definition and examples of use case descriptions. Your format should resemble my examples.

\subsection{Example case 2 (jank6275)}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2cm} p{12cm} }
 \hline
 \\
 \textit{Actor:} & car driver \\ 
 \\
 \textit{Goal:} & to leave the parking lot \\
 \\
 \textit{Precondition:} & driver previously entered the parking lot, picked up a ticket, and has stayed in the lot long enough that they must pay to leave. \\
 \\
 \textit{Summary:} & driver brings their vehicle to an exit lane, inserts their ticket into a machine, and pays the amount shown on the machine. \\ 
 \\
 \textit{Steps:} & \begin{enumerate}
  \item Drive to exit lane, triggering a sensor.
  \item System prompts driver to insert their ticket.
  \item Insert ticket.
  \item System displays amount due.
  \item Insert money into slot until cash in exceeds amount due.
  \item System returns change (if any) and raises exit barrier.
  \item Drive through exit, triggering a sensor.
  \item Lower exit barrier.
 \end{enumerate} \\
 \\
 \textit{Alternative:} & User crashes through exit barrier with rambars on front of truck in step 1. (just kidding) \\
 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
