\caption{Squire will be a web-based collaborative integrated development environment with a project development center. Squire will allow multiple users to edit files and communicate in real time. First, projects are stubbed out by a user and then other users can join and/or vote to support for their favorite projects. After a certain amount of support, planning, and documentation is reached for a project, the project becomes a fully fleged project and then community development can start. Think kickstarter for code where people pledge their help with the project and not just money.}
