<H1> CS383 HW#1: Study the Application Domain </h1>

Due: 2:00pm Wednesday January 27, via Blackboard
Include the full names and canonical e-mail addresses of
coauthors on a title page at the front of the document you turn in.

<p>

This week, analyze your application domain,
described at
<A href="http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/courses/383/squire.html">
squire.html</A>.  Feel free to
send the instructor questions, suggestions, and ideas, and please
check back (refresh) this page and the starpad.html from time to time
this week, as I may add requirements.  Note that based on next Wednesday's
turnin of HW#1, I may decide to adopt one of the teams' efforts
wholesale, or merge ideas from multiple teams' work, or insert/substitute
arbitrary details of my own devising.


<p>
You are to work in the following (randomly assigned) teams:

</pre>

Meet your team members and exchange contact information. Discuss
schedule availability for CS 383 work.  Meet with your team during
the scheduled class periods of Fri. 1/22 and Mon 1/25 and work on
this homework. Take attendance, and elect someone from your team
to e-mail me attendance and a brief summary after each hours' meeting.
<p>

Although it is a team assignment, each individual's work is to be
identified on the written homework turnin discussed below.
Be sure all authors' names are associated with anything that
is turned in that was a joint effort; this can be on a per paragraph, per
section, or per document basis.  <p>

<h3> Start Learning LaTeX </h3>

If you do not know LaTeX, learn it from one or more of the following:

<ul>
<li> <A href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/misc/latex-tutorial/latex-home.html">Cornell's</A>
<li> <A href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/">Wilkins</A>
</ul>

There is no additional deliverable turnin for this part of the assignment.

<h3> Start on Github </h3>

Create an account on <A href="http://github.com">Github</A>,
if you do not have one.  E-mail me (Dr. J) with your Github userid.

<h3> Document <em>Requirements</em> </h3>

You are to construct an LaTeX document with the following components.
<ul>
<li> Results from application domain study, e.g. examination and test
     of a similar (previous and/or manual) system.

<li> Major expansion ("fleshing out") of the basic premise of this program
     Agree with your team on the basics (objective(s)),
     and then break this task out into
     individual or 2-person assignments.

<li> Divide the application domain specification up approximately
     evenly by volume amongst your team members. Note who was
     assigned what sections, by name and number.
    Each team member should, for their assigned sections:

<ol>
<li> Identify how many distinct kinds of user/player tasks are required.
     A task is a set of user actions that combine together to form a
     single indivisible phase a distinct change of state for those
     hases where multiple changes of state can occur.

<li> your assessment of the requirements for a computer adaptation of your
assigned parts of the application domain.
How will manual elements be translated?  What parts have to change?
What parts of the manual (or legacy) system can be retained as-is?
You can include sketches or sample screen shots of what various 
application domain elements should look like in the new system.

<li> A set of <em><A href="lecture.html#usecases">use case</A> descriptions</em> of the tasks in #1 above.
Read the lecture notes (and/or google it) for definition and examples
of use case descriptions. Your format should resemble my examples.

</ol>
</ul>
