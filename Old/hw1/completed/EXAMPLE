Exit parking lot, paying cash
-----------------------------
Actor: car driver
Goal: to leave the parking lot
Precondition: driver previously entered the parking lot, picked up a ticket, and has stayed in the lot long enough that they must pay to leave.
Summary: driver brings their vehicle to an exit lane, inserts their ticket into a machine, and pays the amount shown on the machine.
Related use case: exit parking lot, paying via credit card.

Steps:
1. Drive to exit lane, triggering a sensor.
2. System prompts driver to insert their ticket.
3. Insert ticket.
4. System displays amount due.
5. Insert money into slot until cash in exceeds amount due. 
6. System returns change (if any) and raises exit barrier
7. Drive through exit, triggering a sensor.
8. Lower exit barrier

Alternative: User crashes through exit barrier with rambars on front of truck in step 1. (just kidding)
Postconditions: None

  \item The most common sequence of actions that are performed for this task. Lethbridge divides actions into two columns: user input is given in the left column, while system response is given in the right column. The two column format is optional, but saves on paper and may improve clarity. The steps are numbered, so there is no ambiguity in using both columns on each line.
