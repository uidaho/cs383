From here, the Compiler will select the appropriate CompilerPlugin determined by the configured compiler for the project. The compiler also invokes the SnapshotManager, which stores the current state of the code to be used during compilation.

The JavaCompiler plugin retrieves the code snapshot from the SnapshotManager and compiles the code.\relax }}{1}}
