        \captionof{figure}{"Squire is a web-based collaborative software development environment with a project development center. Squire will allow multiple users to edit files and communicate in real time. Projects can be ``stubbed'' out by a user and then other users can join and/or vote to support for their favorite projects. After a certain amount of support, planning, and documentation is reached for a project, the project becomes a fully fleged project and then community development can start. Think ``kickstarter for code'' where people pledge their help with the project and not just financial support."}

\section{Core Features}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Web based
      \item Some Common IDE features
      \item Collaborative tools
      \item Encapsulated Workspaces
      \item Compile and Download
      \item Self Destructing Rooms
    \end{itemize}
    The central idea behind sQuire is a somewhat akin to a code hostel. A collaborative editor which provides private, but shareable on demand spaces, with a low overhead for creation and ease of use. These spaces are meant for short term use, over an indeterminate period. Once the collaboration is done, the space is cleared and made available for others to use.
    
    With this vision in mind, sQuire best accomodates its users by being a browser based application. There should be no need for a user to download a client program, which would require periodic updates and ultimately require deletion on the users' end. By doing all of the collaboration and storage on a central server, accessed by the browser, we can make it more accessible to a wider audience. It may also encourage the development of collaborative ``toy'' projects by making it easier to start project spaces and find assistance when a project stalls.
    
    sQuire will be focused on coding in the Java language, though there are many worthwhile languages to choose from. Focusing on a single language will allow us to add more IDE-like features to assist in collaboration and make the language more accessible to those learning it.
    IDE-like Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Key word color coding
      \item Parenthesis mismatch detection
      \item Missing end of line detection/prompting
    \end{itemize}
    
    sQuire is a collaborative tool, rather than a fully featured IDE with step through run-time debugging. Its features should be geared towards making it easier to debug code collaboratively, in the browser, without over-reliance on other tools. At a minimum, it needs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Native chat functionality
      \item Author attribution for code (colored underlining, footnote, etc.)
      \item Ability to jump to another user's cursor
      \item Ability to import/export code as plain text
      \item Account based access to projects
    \end{itemize}
    
    Collaborative features that would be nice:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ability to save and restore to snapshots of the project
      \item Achievement and statistic tracking
    \end{itemize}
    
    User workspaces will be encapsulated, for both security and privacy. This could be accomplished using a container solution such as Docker or lmctfy (a free Google version). Containers have a lower performance hit to the host server than virtual machines, which are also a commonly implemented solution.  
    
    While security is a concern, we hope to address this using user space encapsulation, and by not running user code on the server. When users compile code, the compiled jar is downloaded and run locally from their own machines. While this means users are responsible for vetting the function of the code before running it on their machines, it means that our server resources are not being used as part of a bot net or similar exploit.
    
    Finally rooms must be self-destructing. For the convenience of the user, deletion of the space should be automatic after an appropriate period of inactivity. While a notification email should be sent to the space owner prior to deletion, again no user intervention should be required.

\section{Security Nightmare}
    The issue of security comes to mind every time compiling and executing an outside application in a secure area. Rooting or destroying data and infrastructure is trivial when you are freely allowed to execute arbitrary Java. In order to allow for this functionality we must implement some type of security strategy. We could limit or block functionality in Java which is a cat and mouse game that breaks usability. We could compile and execute code on the client side. Using a web browser, this would require a compiler written in JavaScript and cause compatibility issues on certain clients with reduced permissions or an exotic build environment. Or we could just Docker.


    Docker allows us to create containers that contain not only the user's build environment, but the server infrastructure to host their project. Containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers. Simply put, users can destroy their own containers but nobody elseâ€™s. Obviously we will want to harden against known and obvious vectors, but at least any damage a user can do is limited to their own project. Containerization also allows us to take snapshots so that even if something goes wrong, we can always revert back to a working state.

\chapter{Requirements Documentation}
\section{Functional Requirements}
    Functional requirements will specify a behaviour or function. Squire's functional requirements are:
    \subsection{Communication (jank6275)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Global chat when anywhere in program. (Usecase 3.1.2 and Class 4.2)
            \item Project chat when a project is open. (Usecase 3.1.1 and Class 4.2)
            \item Closeable project chat. (Usecase 3.1.3 and Class 4.2)
            \item Closeable global chat. (Usecase 3.1.4 and Class 4.2)
        \end{itemize}

    
\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
    Non-functional requirements cover all the remaining requirements which are not covered by the functional requirements. They specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. Squire's non-functional requirements are:
    \begin{itemize}
        % Performance (jank6275)
        \item The editor will be multi-user, up to 32 users can share an IDE session. (jank6275)
        \item The current location of any user's cursor can be quickly jumped to by any user with the project open. (jank6275)
        \item Text written by the user in the editor should be visible instantaneously. (jank6275)
        \item Text written by other users in the editor should be visible within 2 seconds. (jank6275)
        \item Text will be underlined in the user's color, if they edited/created that text. (jank6275)
        \item The line number will be highlighted in the users color, if they created the line. (jank6275)
        \item Each line edited by a user should be saved to create a edit history for each user in a document. (jank6275)
        \item Users will be able to edit the same document concurrently. (jank6275)
        \item Any user can save the document at any time. (jank6275)
    \end{itemize}
