\chapter{Overview and Scope}

        \captionof{figure}{"Squire is a web-based collaborative software development environment with a project development center. Squire will allow multiple users to edit files and communicate in real time. Projects can be ``stubbed'' out by a user and then other users can join and/or vote to support for their favorite projects. After a certain amount of support, planning, and documentation is reached for a project, the project becomes a fully fleged project and then community development can start. Think ``kickstarter for code'' where people pledge their help with the project and not just financial support."}
    \end{minipage}

\section{Core Features}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Web based
      \item Some Common IDE features
      \item Collaborative tools
      \item Encapsulated Workspaces
      \item Compile and Download
      \item Self Destructing Rooms
    \end{itemize}
    The central idea behind sQuire is a somewhat akin to a code hostel. A collaborative editor which provides private, but shareable on demand spaces, with a low overhead for creation and ease of use. These spaces are meant for short term use, over an indeterminate period. Once the collaboration is done, the space is cleared and made available for others to use.
    
    With this vision in mind, sQuire best accomodates its users by being a browser based application. There should be no need for a user to download a client program, which would require periodic updates and ultimately require deletion on the users' end. By doing all of the collaboration and storage on a central server, accessed by the browser, we can make it more accessible to a wider audience. It may also encourage the development of collaborative "toy" projects by making it easier to start project spaces and find assistance when a project stalls.
    
    sQuire will be focused on coding in the Java language, though there are many worthwhile languages to choose from. Focusing on a single language will allow us to add more IDE-like features to assist in collaboration and make the language more accessible to those learning it.
    IDE-like Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Key word color coding
      \item Parenthesis mismatch detection
      \item Missing end of line detection/prompting
    \end{itemize}
    
    sQuire is a collaborative tool, rather than a fully featured IDE with step through run-time debugging. Its features should be geared towards making it easier to debug code collaboratively, in the browser, without over-reliance on other tools. At a minimum, it needs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Native chat functionality
      \item Author attribution for code (colored underlining, footnote, etc.)
      \item Ability to "jump to" another user's cursor
      \item Ability to import/export code as plain text
      \item Account based access to projects
    \end{itemize}
    
    Collaborative features that would be "nice":
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ability to save/restore to "snapshots" of the project
      \item Achievement and statistic tracking
    \end{itemize}
    
    User workspaces will be encapsulated, for both security and privacy. This could be accomplished using a container solution such as Docker or lmctfy (a free Google version). Containers have a lower performance hit to the host server than virtual machines, which are also a commonly implemented solution.  
    
    While security is a concern, we hope to address this using user space encapsulation, and by not running user code on the server. When users compile code, the compiled jar is downloaded and run locally from their own machines. While this means users are responsible for vetting the function of the code before running it on their machines, it means that our server resources are not being used as part of a bot net or similar exploit.
    
    Finally rooms must be self-destructing. For the convenience of the user, deletion of the space should be automatic after an appropriate period of inactivity. While a notification email should be sent to the space owner prior to deletion, again no user intervention should be required.

\section{Storage and Organization}
    The squire program will have a top down directory structure.
    Under the top domain, each individual registered user will have the ability to create projects (rooms) where they can build their program. 
    Inside the room the user will be able to create any number of files or pages to keep track of their project. 
    They will also have the ability to import and export files to and from their own machine and the project. 
    After creation the user will be able to switch between projects and create and delete pages from within the project itself.  
    They will have the ability to share their projects and invite other users to read or edit their work. 
    All of the user data, as well as each user’s relevant project and page information, as well as who has access to each project will be stored and maintained by a MySQL database.

\section{Execution}
    The Squire program will have a browser based client. Squire users can use this client to login their account, manipulate their project, and logout. The Squire editor will run clientside through Ace. Ace is an embeddable code editor written in JavaScript. It can be easily embedded in any web page, JavaScript application, and browser based client. On the other hand, the user data, user project, and edit information will saved in a MySQL database on the owner's hard drive.  

\section{Collaboration}
    The code editor will be a collaborative editor. Multiple users can edit the same file at the same time. This means that any changes one user makes need to be synced to the server, and then to the editors of any other users editing the same file. Some research shows that all popular collaborate editors (Google Docs, Cloud 9, etc) use an algorithm called Operational Transformation. On a basic level, this algorithm works by treating every change to a file as either an insert command, or a delete command. These commands are synced across clients to keep the file state the same. Squire will need something similar. It looks like there are several open source implementations of this algorithm, notably OT.js. These may or may not be adequate for use in Squire.
 
\section{Achievement System}
    In order to make Squire interesting, but still retain its usability, Squire will contain an achievement system. Achievements will be publicly visible to all users in the user's profile. When a user gains an achievement, it will be announced in the project chat. Achievements should be fun, and should be obtainable just by writing code (i.e, users shouldn’t have to actively try to get achievements). Some possible achievements: Lucky Break (a file compiles successfully on the first try), Social Butterfly (a user joins a project that has 10+ users), Job Security (Write a 1000+ line file without any comments).
    
\section{Chat System}
    We will most likely use a websocket-based chat system for sQuire, as it allows the easiest modification; Users and their coded colors will be listed, and their names next to their chat lines. The goal is to make a simple and lightweight, secure chat that allows users to collaborate with each other in an area outside the workspace.

\section{Permissions System (bolt1003)}
    Squire will have a permissions system that encompasses files, folders, users and rooms. The administrator will have the ability to delegate permission to other users.  The administrator will have the ability to set global permissions to users to control read, write, execute, room creation and sharing.  Each room with have its own set of permissions. These permissions are controlled by the moderator that is assigned to that room and the administrator. By default the creator of the room is the moderator of the room but this duty can be delegated to another if desired. The system has three default user groups, Administrator, Moderators and Users. Users have the ability to read, write and execute code by default. Moderators have the ability to manage rooms by adding or removing users to their rooms, creating sub-rooms and managing moderators for those rooms. Administrators have all encompassing power over all permissions in the system.

\section{Interface Structure (mora5651)}
    Since sQuire is an online collaborative editor, and interface structure plays a key roll in organizing all the features to fit properly. We decided in using Cloud9's interface as a base for sQuire's interface layout/structure. Cloud9 incorporates many of the same features as sQuire including file management, editor, and chat options. Other collaborative IDEs to consider Floobits, Kobra, and Codebox. 
    
\section{Security Nightmare (jank6275)}
    The issue of security comes to mind every time compiling and executing an outside application in a secure area. Rooting or destroying data and infrastructure is trivial when you are freely allowed to execute arbitrary Java. In order to allow for this functionality we must implement some type of security strategy. We could limit or block functionality in Java which is a cat and mouse game that breaks usability. We could compile and execute code on the client side. This would require a compiler written in JavaScript and cause compatibility issues on certain clients with reduced permissions or an exotic build environment. Or we could just Docker.


    Docker allows us to create containers that contain not only the user's build environment, but the server infrastructure to host their project. Containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers. Simply put, users can destroy their own containers but nobody else’s. Obviously we will want to harden against known and obvious vectors, but at least any damage a user can do is limited to their own project. Containerization also allows us to take snapshots so that even if something goes wrong, we can always revert back to a working state.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
    Non-functional requirements cover all the remaining requirements which are not covered by the functional requirements. They specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. Squire's non-functional requirements are:
    \begin{itemize}
        % Performance (jank6275)
        \item The current location of any user's cursor can be quickly jumped to by any user with the project open. (Usecase 4.5.8 and Class 5.9)
        \item Text written by the user in the editor should be visible instantaneously. (Usecase 4.5 and Class 5.9)
        \item Text written by other users in the editor should be visible within 2 seconds. (Usecase 4.5 and Class 5.9)
        \item Text will be underlined in the user's color, if they edited/created that text. (Usecase 4.5.9 and Class 5.9)
        \item The line number will be highlighted in the users color, if they created the line. (Usecase 4.5.9 and Class 5.9)
        \item Each line edited by a user should be saved to create a edit history for each user in a document. (Usecase 4.5.4 and Class 5.9)
        % Scalability (boss2849)
        \item The system should be designed in such a way that will easily and reliably scale to accommodate a growing user base. One method of dealing with scalability would be allowing the core system to reactively spawn new slaves to aid in computational needs, such as compilation. (boss2849)
        % Capacity (boss2849)
        \item Limited space for projects that haven't been initiated (enough for documentation, images, etc.) (boss2849)
        \item Reactively increasing capacity for projects proportional to the absolute needs of the projects. (no fluff) (boss2849)
        \item Encourage developers to store large files elsewhere, e.g. GitHub LFS, AWS, etc. (boss2849)
        % Availability (brec9824) 
        \item Since sQuire is web based, downtime for the servers most be kept to a minimum and be no more then once or twice a week for a few hours. This downtime will allow for database uprgrades and backups. (brec9824)
        % Reliability (bolt1003) 
        \item sQuire will leverage technology developed for the web to ensure reliablity. Technologies such as redunant hardware, redunant power providers, redunant internet services, load balancing and virtualization will enable sQuire to be reliable.(bolt1003)
        % Recoverability (mora5651) 
        \item SQuire will have the ability for the user to save on sQuire's database for recoverability isurance. It will also incorporate autosave feature. (mora5651)
        % Maintainability (mora5651) 
        \item Since sQuire is a web based application running on a webhost. There are 
        many maintenance tools that can be used to track performance. Maintainability of sQuire will also include regular backup schedules, speed test, and security monotoring. (mora5651)
        % Serviceability (bolt1003) 
        \item sQuire will run in a virtual machine on top of redunant hardware. Using a virtual machine allows for mutliple instance to be running and tested. The backend will run on redunant hardware which will prevent hardware failure from affecting sQuire usage. In turn, allowing infrastructure to be serviced without affecting sQuire. (bolt1003)
        % Security (jank6275)
        \item Each project should be containerized so that users can't harm each others projects. (jank6275)
        % Regulatory (mars2681) 
        \item Upon creation of account, user must agree to terms and conditions. (mars2681)
        \item User must comply with DMCA (Copy right law) (mars2681)
        \item User must confirm they are 18 or older (COPPA law) (mars2681)
        % Manageability (brec9824) 
        \item Will include monitoring of subsystems to collect and report performance data. (brec9824)
        \item Subsystem monititory must be highly efficient and take up less than 10\% of resources to keep noticeability to a minimum. (brec9824)
        \item Subsystems must be modular to allow for efficient monitoring, implementation of subsystems, and the addition of new subsystems. (brec9824)
        % Environmental (gall7417) 
        \item sQuire will run as a browser application in google chrome. (gall7417)
        \item sQire will run on virtually all modern processors. (gall7417)
        % Data Integrity (gall7417) 
        \item sQuire will use tcp to for reliable data communications. (gall7417)
        \item sQuire will use error checking upon large changes to ensure no drastic data corruption occurs. (gall7417)
        \item sQuire will use a history/autosave feature in case of data loss. (gall7417)
        % Usability (snev7821) 
        \item Provides code compilation and file system for users with limited resources. (snev7821)
        \item Easy to learn system, helpful syntax highlighting. (snev7821)
        \item More satisfying than competitors products, because of social/kickstarter aspect. (snev7821)
        % Interoperability (snev7821) 
        \item Provides github integration. (snev7821)
        \item Runs on any of the main browsers (chrome, firefox, safari). (snev7821)
        \item Due to web based design, works on lower end machines. (snev7821)
